# MTG Python Deckbuilder ${VERSION}

### Summary
- Alternative suggestions in the build wizard now surface the replacement card preview immediately and reload the list after a swap.

### Added
- Alternatives panel includes a "New pool" button so you can request a fresh batch of suggestions without rerunning the stage.

### Changed
- Alternative suggestion buttons expose role, mana, and rarity metadata to hover previews for better at-a-glance context.

### Fixed
- Previewing an alternative card now shows the replacement instead of the currently slotted card, and the list refreshes automatically after choosing an alternative.
