# MTG Python Deckbuilder v2.3.2

## Summary
- Theme catalog pagination buttons now re-run HTMX processing after fragment fetches so “Next” works reliably in the picker and simple catalog views.
- Docker entrypoint seeds default theme catalog configuration files into volume-backed deployments, keeping Docker Hub images ready out of the box.

## Fixed
- Theme catalog Next pagination button now reprocesses HTMX fragments after manual fetches, restoring navigation controls in theme picker and simple catalog modes.
- Docker entrypoint seeds default `config/themes` YAML files (synergy pairs, clusters, whitelist, etc.) into mounted volumes so Docker Hub deployments have the expected baseline data.
