# MTG Python Deckbuilder v2.8.1

### Summary
Improved colorless commander support with automatic card filtering and display fixes.

### Added
**Colorless Commander Filtering**: 25 cards that don't work in colorless decks are now automatically excluded. This prevents cards like Arcane Signet, Commander's Sphere, and medallions (which reference "commander's color identity" or colored spells) from being suggested for colorless commanders like Karn, Kozilek, or Liberator. Colored commanders still have access to all cards.

### Fixed
**Colorless Commander Display**: Fixed three bugs affecting colorless commander decks:
- Color identity now displays correctly with a grey "C" button and "Colorless" label
- Wastes now correctly added as basic lands (14-15 copies instead of just 1)
- Colored basics (Plains, Island, etc.) no longer incorrectly added to colorless decks
