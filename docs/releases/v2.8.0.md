# MTG Python Deckbuilder v2.8.0

### Summary
Theme catalog improvements with faster processing, tag search features, regeneration fixes, and browser performance optimizations.

### Added
- **Theme Catalog Optimization**:
  - Consolidated theme enrichment pipeline (single pass instead of 7 separate scripts)
  - Tag index for fast theme-based card queries
  - Tag search API with new endpoints for card search, autocomplete, and popular tags
  - Commander browser theme autocomplete with keyboard navigation
  - Tag loading infrastructure for batch operations
- **Theme Browser Keyboard Navigation**: Arrow keys now navigate search results (ArrowUp/Down, Enter to select, Escape to close)

### Changed
- **Theme Browser Performance**: Theme detail pages now load much faster
  - Disabled YAML file scanning in production (use `THEME_CATALOG_CHECK_YAML_CHANGES=1` during theme authoring)
  - Cache invalidation now checks theme_list.json instead of scanning all files
- **Theme Browser UI**: Removed color filter from theme catalog

### Fixed
- **Theme Regeneration**: Theme catalog can now be fully rebuilt from scratch without placeholder data
  - Fixed "Anchor" placeholder issue when regenerating catalog
  - Examples now generated from actual card data
  - Theme export preserves all metadata fields
