# Test: Deck List Display Feature

This demonstrates the new feature added for v1.0.0 that automatically displays the completed deck list at the end of the build process.

## What's New

When a deck build completes successfully, the application will now:

1. **Export both CSV and TXT files** (as before)
2. **Automatically display the TXT contents** in a formatted box
3. **Show a user-friendly message** indicating the list is ready for copy/paste
4. **Display the file path** where the deck was saved

## Example Output

```
============================================================
DECK LIST - Atraxa_Superfriends_20250821.txt
Ready for copy/paste to Moxfield, EDHREC, or other deck builders
============================================================
1 Atraxa, Praetors' Voice
1 Jace, the Mind Sculptor
1 Elspeth, Knight-Errant
1 Vraska the Unseen
1 Sol Ring
1 Command Tower
1 Breeding Pool
... (rest of deck)
============================================================
Deck list also saved to: deck_files/Atraxa_Superfriends_20250821.txt
============================================================
```

## Benefits

- **No more hunting for files**: Users see their deck immediately
- **Quick upload to online platforms**: Perfect format for Moxfield, EDHREC, etc.
- **Still saves to file**: Original file-based workflow unchanged
- **Clean formatting**: Easy to read and copy

## Technical Details

- Uses the existing `export_decklist_text()` method
- Adds new `_display_txt_contents()` method for pretty printing
- Only displays on successful deck completion
- Handles file errors gracefully with fallback messages
- Preserves all existing functionality

This feature addresses the common user workflow of wanting to immediately share or upload their completed deck lists without navigating the file system.
